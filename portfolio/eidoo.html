        Eidoo is a Swiss company that deals with cryptocurrencies, in particular,
        its main product is the wallet of the same name. Thanks to Eidoo it is
        possible to receive, exchange and buy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum,
        EDO (the ICO of Eidoo), and many others.
      </p>
      <h2 class="">The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="paragraph--small">
        We have supported the Eidoo team for more than a year in the design, evolution
        and maintenance of a cryptocurrency wallet. The challenge was to create a usable
        tool for both novice and advanced traders, together with the design of an application
        that interact with blockchains.
      </p>

      <h2 class="">Discovery and personas</h2>
      <p class="paragraph--small">
        We approached the project by mapping together with the client an eventstorming
         and some proto-personas, within an initial discovery workshop. Then, through
         interviews with users, we validated and consolidated the three main Personas by
         distributing them within a user journey map.
      </p>

      <h2 class="">See/do maps, userflows and wireframes</h2>
      <p class="paragraph--small">
        Starting from the flow described by the user journey map, we created the
        wireframes of the first version of the application which was validated by
        the product owner and designed as UI mockups. From here we started a double-track
        agile process: Development and UX team.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph--small">
        I worked in the UX team with activities that included stakeholder interviews,
        benchmarking, see/do map, user flow, and wireframe lo-fi that allowed rapid user
        testing and validation by the business. But I also helped the development team in
        implementing UI design and interactions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="">UI and design system</h2>
      <p class="paragraph--small">
        We tried to keep closer UI design with front-end, working with a modular
        and Atomic design logic. The formalization of guidelines within a small
        design system has been very useful for creating coherence within the various
        Eidoo microservices and applying the brand guidelines.
