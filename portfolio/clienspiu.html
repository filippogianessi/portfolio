        CliensPiù is just one of the Giuffrè software for the law firm: the existence of many products, many developed internally or by other partners, led to having inconsistent and therefore difficult to use software. As a frontend team, a framework has been developed consisting of interface, layout and style components. The framework, called "Instrumenti", was subsequently evolved towards a design system, thanks to the definition of guidelines that identify the essence of what good team design means and shared practices on how to use it.

      <p class="paragraph--small">
        Through the product vision, we thought - within a workshop - about what could be the design principles that characterize the CliensPiù product. These were the guide for the definition of the first design patterns, that is, reusable and repeatable blocks of the interface.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph--small">
        Together with the Giuffrè team, within a second day of workshops, we analyzed the application thanks to tools such as the degree of specificity and the structure of the contents. The definition of the key behaviors and actions contained in these have allowed us to cluster widespread patterns and to name them in a shared way, according to the domain and purpose of the product defined in the previous activity.

        The results were then formalized within a shared document, in particular as regards the list and table elements, or the components most present in CliensPiù. Furthermore, work has been done on a clear definition of the textual styles of the UI: label, call-to-action, titles and text bodies.The results were then formalized within a shared document, in particular as regards the list and table elements, or the components most present in CliensPiù.

      <p class="paragraph--small">
From here, thanks to short iterative cycles, we continued to integrate the parts of the application not yet fully analyzed. By carrying out an analysis of the heuristics, which examined the screens most used by users, problems and opportunities for evolution compatible with the design system definition activities were identified. One of these was the need to have a new color palette that extended the current one and made the information more understandable and consistent. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the need to make interaction and navigation elements, such as buttons, intuitive and accessible, to distinguish them from other interface elements such as tags and labels.

This was a first draft of the most shared and widespread patterns, but the formalization and evolution of a design system never ends by definition: as Alla Kholmatova says this type of activity is "like gardening": the more it is taken care of the greater the results and the quality.
